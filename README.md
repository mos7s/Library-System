- Persistent data storage using PostgreSQL.
- Simplified development experience with Spring Boot DevTools.
- Leveraging Lombok for boilerplate code reduction.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3.4.0**
- **Spring Data JPA** for ORM and database operations.
- **PostgreSQL** as the database.
- **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate Java code.
- **Maven** for build and dependency management.
